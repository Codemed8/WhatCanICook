# WhatCanICook?
Flask web application to help you decide what to cook.

Pick from a list of ingredients that you have at home. The application will recommend you recipes that you can make with those ingredients. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/).

To run:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Ambitions

The project was intended to help me better understand the Flask framework. 

In the future I would like to:
- Improve the layout of the index page
- Add more recipes and ingredients
- Improve testing

Pull requests are welcome.
